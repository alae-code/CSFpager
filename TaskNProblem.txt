# CSFpager
my project for CSF.

gonna need 2 minikeyboard to put on the microntroller

PROBLEM TO RESOLVE:
X Need to buy a LoRa receiver-transmetor for the Arduino Board
X Need to but 2 mini keyboard
X How to link the keyboard to the board, what kind of input will it receive, need to translate to hardcoded maybe then to exadecimal
X Code a program for sending it on the other board by LORA
- Need to be able to not functiun when messages sended bot at the same time
- Need to code an interface
X Need to swap one of the card because the verison that support the atmega328PB doesnt work (getting crazy a bit)
X Also need to swap the 328P card that is compatible because the female pin on the scl and sda dont work much (old and used seems)
- Do a read me and organize the git
